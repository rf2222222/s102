This is a very outdated set of API integrations with various exchanges.

This should not be used to make money. If this code were to be updated, it should be used only for donation to trading counterparties over a short or longer duration, depending on set parameters. (e.g. Providing liquidity to your coin from the balance on your account with pl parameters adjusted to ensure sufficient amount of donation happens throughout each transaction. The larger the donation amount, the better and more predictable the behavior becomes, building trust in the community through your account transactions history)
